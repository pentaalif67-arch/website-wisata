Please save the background image you uploaded here with the filename exactly:

    dashboard-bg.jpg

Full path:

    public/image/dashboard-bg.jpg

Recommended: resize the photo to around 1920x1080 (or similar wide aspect) for best results. Clear Laravel view/cache if you don't see the change:

    php artisan view:clear; php artisan cache:clear

If you prefer a different filename, update the CSS background URL in `resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php` to match the filename you chose.
